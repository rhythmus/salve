# AI Agent Code of Conduct

## 📝 Commit Message Style

Follow this format consistently for all commits.

### Structure

```
<type>: <concise summary in lowercase imperative mood>

<body: what was done and why, wrapped at ~72 chars per line>
```

### Type Prefixes

| Prefix | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| `feat` | Adding or extending functionality (new decoders, new modules, new CLI flags, new UI features) |
| `fix` | Correcting a bug or incorrect behaviour |
| `refactor` | Restructuring code without changing behaviour (renames, moves, extractions) |
| `docs` | Documentation-only changes (README, spec, ROADMAP, AGENTS.md, comments) |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests without changing production code |
| `chore` | Tooling, CI, dependency bumps, config changes with no user-facing impact |

### Rules

1. **Subject line**: lowercase after the prefix colon, imperative mood ("add", not "added" or "adds"), no trailing period, ideally under 72 characters.

2. **Body**: separated from subject by a blank line. Describe *what* was delivered and *why*. Use plain sentences or a concise bulleted list. Name files, interfaces, and design choices where relevant. Wrap at ~72 characters.

3. **Scope tags** (e.g. `feat(parser):`) are not used in this project — keep it simple.

4. **Group logically**: one commit per cohesive unit of work (e.g. one ROADMAP phase, one feature area). Do not mix unrelated changes; do not split a single feature across many tiny commits.

5. **No noise**: do not commit generated files (`dist/`, `docs/api/`), secrets, or empty commits.
